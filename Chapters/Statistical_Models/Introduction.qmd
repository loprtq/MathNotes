# Statistical Models {#sec-Statistical_Models}
This part will dive deeper into some of the models used in statistics, which do not naturally fit into one of the other chapters.


## Covariates
Covariates are the explanatory variables used to predict or explain the response variable in a statistical model. They represent the factors that may influence the outcome of interest. Covariates can be broadly classified into two main types based on their nature, described in the following subsections.

### Discrete/categorical variables
Discrete or categorical covariates take on a limited set of distinct values, representing different categories or groups. Examples include age groups ($\geq 75$, $75>x\geq 50$, $50>$), gender (male, female), or country of origin. In statistical models, categorical variables are typically encoded using indicator/dummy variables, where each level of the variable, except a reference level, gets its own binary variable taking the value 0 or 1.

### Continuous variables
Continuous covariates can take any value within a range and typically represent quantitative measurements. Examples include age, weight, or temperature. Continuous covariates are often included directly in models, though they may sometimes be transformed to better satisfy model assumptions or describe non-linear relationships with the response variable.


## Fixed Effects {#sec-Fixed_Effects}
Fixed effects describe the average relationship between covariates and the response variable - the systematic effects within a group. In the context of linear models (see @sec-Linear_Regression), fixed effects are the coefficients that quantify how the expected value of the response variable changes with the covariates. These effects are "fixed" in the sense that they are constant across all observations in the population, though they may vary across different levels of discrete/categorical covariates.

As an example, consider the height of a group of 20 year old males. For examples sake, the only difference between these males is there height when they were 10 years old. In this example, the fixed effects would capture the systemic growth pattern shared by all 20-year-old males in the population. This includes the average height at age 10 (fixed intercept) and the average rate of growth over the 10-year period (fixed slope). These parameters describe the general trajectory that applies to the entire group, before considering individual variations.


## Random Effects {#sec-Random_Effects}
As opposed to the fixed effects, which describe a group effects, the random effects are able to describe individual devations, such as if an individual generally has larger values (random intercept), or has a tendency to evolve/progress differently than the whole group (random slope).

Continuing with the height example described in the fixed effects section, there should be some form of correlation between their height at age 10 and then at age 20. If one were to try and model this under a linear assumption, one thought might be to model them individually, but with this approach information about the systemic growth would be lost. The other solution would be to try and model the systemic growth, but then their individual characteristics would be lost. Instead, one should use a linear mixed model (see @sec-Linear_Mixed_Model) which both derives the systemic growth (fixed effects) and their individual characterstics (random effects). Adding a random intercept would, as the name suggests, allow each male to have their own intercept. Adding a random slope, would allow each male have a larger or lower slope, when looking at how their height has increased in the 10 years.
