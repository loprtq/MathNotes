# Mixed Models for Repeated Measures {#sec-Mixed_Model_for_Repeated_Measures}


When working with a treatment policy strategy, the MMRM might not be the best choice. The MMRM assumes that the missing data follows the MAR assumption. However, if a non-negligible amount of that missing data is caused by ICEs, then this violates the model's assumptions.

The MMRM cannot distinguish between data before and after an IE (ref p.2, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12850)
