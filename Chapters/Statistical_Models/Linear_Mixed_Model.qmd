# Linear Mixed Model {#sec-Linear_Mixed_Model}
Expanding upon the concepts introduced in @sec-Linear_Regression and @sec-Random_Effects, the following will allow the linear regression to take into consideration if there are some individual variability in the data (see @exm-Linear_Mixed_Model_Simple). Thus, similar to how the fixed effects are inccorporrated in the linear regression, the random effects can be included as $Z \cdot \beta$, where $Z$ describes the design matrix for the random effects and $\beta$ the random effect regression coefficients. Hereby, the linear mixed model is defined as:
$$
y = X \cdot \alpha + Z \cdot \beta + \varepsilon.
$$

To justify the addtion of the random effects, the data somehow has to include some individual devation.

#### Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) {#sec-MMRM}
When working with a treatment policy strategy, the MMRM might not be the best choice. The MMRM assumes that the missing data follows the MAR assumption. However, if a non-negligible amount of that missing data is caused by ICEs, then this violates the model's assumptions.

The MMRM cannot distinguish between data before and after an IE (ref p.2, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12850)
