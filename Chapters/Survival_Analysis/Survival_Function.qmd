# Survival function {#sec-SurvivalFunction}
To describe how probable it is for a person to survive until some time $t$, we can use the concept of stochastic variables. More precisely, the CDF (see @sec-CDF) can be used to describe the probability that an event occurs prior to time $t$ - $\operatorname{P}(T \leq t)$. However in survival analysis, the opposite is of interest - that a person has survived past time $t$. Thus, the survival function can be defined as
$$
\begin{aligned}
S(t) &= \operatorname{P}(T > t) \\&= 1 - F(t)
\end{aligned}
$$
where $F$ is the CDF of the stochastic variable $T$ - stochastic event time.

**Properties**

- Monotonically decreasing, i.e. $S(t_2) \leq S(t_1)$ for all $t_1 \geq t_2$.
