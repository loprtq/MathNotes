# Kaplan-Meier {#sec-Kaplan-Meier}
The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function. 

censoring is independent of survival time.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S(t) &= \prod_{t_i \leq t} \left(1 - \frac{d_{t_i}}{n_{t_i}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
where $t_i$ is the time that an event occured, $d_{t_i}$ is the number of events that occured at this time, and $n_{t_i}$ the number of individuals who has survived up until this time.
