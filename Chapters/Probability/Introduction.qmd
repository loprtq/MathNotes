# Probability Theory
Probability theory is the study of uncertainty and random events. It provides a framework for predicting the likelihood of different outcomes in a given situation. The foundation of probability theory begins with the concept of an experiment, which is any process that leads to an uncertain resultâ€”such as flipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a card. The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment, and an event is any subset of this sample space.

Probability is assigned to events as a number between $0$ and $1$, where $0$ indicates impossibility and $1$ indicates certainty. For example, the probability of rolling a 4 on a fair six-sided die is 1/6. Some basic rules of probability include: the probability of the entire sample space is 1; if two events are mutually exclusive (cannot happen at the same time), the probability that either occurs is the sum of their individual probabilities.
