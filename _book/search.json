The MMRM assumes that the missing data follows the MAR assumption. However, if a non-negligible amount of that missing data is caused by ICEs, then this violates the model’s assumptions.\nThe MMRM cannot distinguish between data before and after an IE (ref p.2, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12850)\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Non-linear mixed models\n\n\n5.2.3 Fixed effects\n\n\n5.2.4 Randon effects\nAs opposed to the fixed effects, which describe a group effects, the random effects are able to describe subject-specific devations, such as if a subject generally has larger values (random intercept), or is a subject has a tendency to evolve/progress differently than the whole group (random slope).
